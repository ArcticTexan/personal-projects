Personal Projects to improve my OOP skills

Largely inspired by "Programming Projects for Intermediate Beginners" from Robert Heaton at
https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/

While these are guided I try my best to do it on my own given only the deliverables as not to cheat per se.

If anybody has any ideas for projects I should try out feel free to reach out to me. I love a good challenge
